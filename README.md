| Experiment | Aim 
|------------|------------------
| 1          | Show that even a small language model can produce high quality stories, by manually handling state and constraining the model
| 2          | Force the LLM to construct a short story which includes specific literature elements (https://thewritepractice.com/elements-of-a-short-story/)
